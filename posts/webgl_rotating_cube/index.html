    <h2 id="my-lovely-rotating-cube">My Lovely Rotating Cube</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been spending some time wrapping my head around graphics programming lately. After a week of wrestling with JavaScript in Hugo and studying WebGL and GLSL, I&rsquo;ve made it all the way to a rotating, lit cube!
<canvas id="gl-canvas"></canvas>
It doesn&rsquo;t look like much, but I&rsquo;ve learned a ton! Even this simple example required understanding a huge variety of concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m manipulating and applying matrices for coordinate system conversion, keeping matrix calculations on the CPU where possible. Inconsistent vocabulary in existing literature was one of my biggest stumbling blocks - I settled on calling my matrices &ldquo;model&rdquo;, &ldquo;view&rdquo;, and &ldquo;projection&rdquo;, and when I combine them, I write the resulting matrix&rsquo;s name in matrix-math order, so that <code>projection * view * model = projectionViewModel</code>. If you&rsquo;re reading this and also find yourself confused with the disparate naming conventions, know that:
<ul>
<li>Local and object space are the same thing.</li>
<li>The model matrix is sometimes called a world matrix since it converts to world space.</li>
<li>The view matrix is sometimes called an inverse-camera matrix, because it&rsquo;s created by applying a matrix inversion to the camera&rsquo;s transform. I&rsquo;ve even seen the camera&rsquo;s transform referred to as the inverse-view, which is just needlessly obfuscating.</li>
<li>View space is sometimes called eye space or camera space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OpenGL&rsquo;s state machine model has some fairly verbose conventions - many of which I now skip over thanks to twgl.js. Getting attribute locations and filling buffers through <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> are just a couple bits of nonsense I would love to never do again.</li>
<li>Coding for a GPU requires a shift in perspective from coding for a CPU. There are lots of restrictions to keep the GPU&rsquo;s massively parallel design working efficiently. My cube uses a GLSL shader that can handle simple ambient and point lighting, using a dot product to calculate a surface&rsquo;s orientation towards a light source and applying a basic quadratic light falloff equation - all math I had very little familiarity with prior to writing this.</li>
<li>Vertices need to be stored with the correct counter-clockwise winding so that <code>GL_CULL_FACES</code> works correctly. This isn&rsquo;t much of an issue when exporting a model, since modeling software typically handles it for you, but in these early stages, experimenting with basic shapes written by hand, it can be a stumbling block.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m animating by updating GL&rsquo;s state each frame, using time as an argument to rotate the model matrix on the y-axis. I&rsquo;m only calculating the model matrix and the projectionViewModel matrix each frame, both on the CPU. A lot of tutorials I found send the time to the shader as a uniform and do these calculations on the GPU, but that&rsquo;s a waste of resources - the GPU will perform these calculations for every vertex, even though they don&rsquo;t change across an object&rsquo;s vertices. The GPU might be the better choice when instancing lots of objects in a single draw call, though. I&rsquo;m not sure yet.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a little bit of color theory involved here.
<ul>
<li>The ambient color is a sky blue, since the sky is the source of most of the ambient light outdoors. I set <code>GL_CLEAR_COLOR</code> to the same blue for a pseudo-HDRI effect.</li>
<li>The light is slightly yellow, which creates a pleasing contrast with the ambient light.</li>
<li>All my colors are somewhat desaturated. If you try to use a blue ambient light with no red or green component and a red object with no green or blue component, the two won&rsquo;t actually interact at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Next up, I want to create and export a slightly more complex object in Blender and get it to display in WebGL. Maybe I&rsquo;ll figure out how to slap a texture on it, too, though I&rsquo;ve always found texturing a bit beyond my meager art skills.</p>
