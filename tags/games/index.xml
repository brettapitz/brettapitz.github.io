      <description>As a kid, I had a handheld version of this game made by Tiger. For my siblings and me, it was neat distraction for a few weeks. Now, with some help from Blender and React, I can make it myself!
Clearly, it&amp;rsquo;s not finished yet. I just wanted to put up my progress with it after a few hours. Getting React and JSX to play nicely with Hugo wasn&amp;rsquo;t much trouble, and the game&amp;rsquo;s logic is pretty straightforward.</description>
