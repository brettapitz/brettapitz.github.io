      <description>Programming from the Ground Up by Jonathan Bartlett is a fantastic introduction to coding in assembly, but the syntax it uses is a bit outdated. While searching for more modern standards, I had trouble finding much related to the GNU Assembler, but plenty for NASM, the Netwide Assembler, which seems to be a lot more common.
So, in the interest of keeping my studies relevant, I decided to translate the coding examples into modern 64-bit NASM.</description>
