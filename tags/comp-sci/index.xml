      <title>Translating GAS to NASM, part 1</title>

      <description>Programming from the Ground Up by Jonathan Bartlett is a fantastic introduction to coding in assembly, but the syntax it uses is a bit outdated. While searching for more modern standards, I had trouble finding much related to the GNU Assembler, but plenty for NASM, the Netwide Assembler, which seems to be a lot more common.
So, in the interest of keeping my studies relevant, I decided to translate the coding examples into modern 64-bit NASM.</description>

      <title>Sorting in Python</title>

      <description>Continuing MIT&amp;rsquo;s Data Structures and Algorithms course today, with my Python code for insertion sort, merge sort, and heap sort.
In all three, I generated a list of n random integers between 0 and n, sorted the list, and then printed the first and last elements to make sure they were expected values, since printing the whole list would take forever with large values of n.
Merge sort came out on top, with heap taking ~50% longer, and insertion taking almost as long to sort 10,000 items as merge took to sort 1,000,000.</description>

      <title>Document Distance Optimization</title>

      <description>One of the first assignments in MIT&amp;rsquo;s Data Structures and Algorithms course on OpenCourseWare is analyzing the evolution of a document distance program across eight iterations. You can download the .py files here, in the Lecture Notes ZIP for Lecture 2.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be using these variables, and looking at the code function by function. Number of Wordsn Number of LinesL Number of Charactersc Number of Unique Wordsu Average Words per Linew  read_file() The only change made to this function is a switch in v8 from readlines(), which returns a list with every line in the file represented as a separate string, to read(), which returns the entire file as a single string.</description>
