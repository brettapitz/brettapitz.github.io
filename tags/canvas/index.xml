      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to delve into the Web Audio API for a while, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know enough about Canvas to do anything interesting. Until now!
The javascript can be found here.
Oscillocope Frequency Bars    The code is mostly a standard use of the API, but I did run into one problem: the Analyser&amp;rsquo;s frequency data is linear, but human hearing is logarithmic. Displaying the raw frequency data would result in 6 octaves (of the 10 that healthy human ears can hear) being condensed into about 6% of the graph.</description>

      <description>I wanted to get to know Canvas, and I thought a simple particle effect would make a nice first project.
The particles are stored as position, speed, and size values in a fixed length pool. Whenever a particle goes offscreen, its data is reset to place it at a random position at the start. A pool simplifies things a great deal - the alternative is spawning new particles and pushing them to an array, and filtering the array every frame to remove dead particles, which is far less efficient, in both speed and memory usage.</description>
