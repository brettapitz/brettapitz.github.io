      <title>Alternating Blocks</title>

      <description>This is a simple pair of blocks that transition between 0 and 1 opacity. I came up with a few ways to do it.
First, using absolute value like this will only ever produce 0 or 1: const toggle = () = { setLeftOpacity(Math.abs(leftOpacity - 1)) setRightOpacity(Math.abs(rightOpacity - 1)) }
And second, using a swap function: const toggle = () = { let temp = leftOpacity; setLeftOpacity(rightOpacity) setRightOpacity(temp) }
And finally, there&amp;rsquo;s conditionals: const toggle = () = { setLeftOpacity(leftOpacity == 1 ?</description>

      <title>Simple To-Do List</title>

      <description>I recently starting undertaking technical interviews, and got my introduction to the famous &amp;ldquo;To-Do List&amp;rdquo; problem. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t looked into the topic before, so I muddled my way through it in my interview. Thinking back on it a day later, I realized that I had made it vastly more complicated than it needed to be, so I recreated it more cleanly. Note to future self: not every element has to be a React component!</description>

      <title>Double Hover</title>

      <description>I love feedback on mouse hover. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple, subtle thing that adds a lot of polish to a user interface. I was browsing the Humble Store and liked how its cards have a &amp;lsquo;dual-hover&amp;rsquo; behaviour - the &amp;lsquo;Buy&amp;rsquo; button changes when the cursor enters any part of the card, and changes again when it enters the button itself. This is really easy to do, but uses some CSS syntax I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s little experiment passes background-color from parent to child in React. Simple enough, although the double bracket syntax for defining styles in JSX is weird. There&amp;rsquo;s not much to this, just a random idea. Neither white nor black text was legible in every square, so I used &amp;lsquo;-webkit-text-stroke&amp;rsquo; in CSS for an outline. Remember: white text with a black outline is easy to read against any background! Here&amp;rsquo;s the JS: const Block = ({val, color}) =&amp;gt; { return ( &amp;lt;div className=&amp;#34;color_block&amp;#34; style={{backgroundColor: color}}&amp;gt;{val}&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; ) } const Rainbow = () =&amp;gt; { return ( &amp;lt;div id=&amp;#39;rainbow&amp;#39;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Block val=&amp;#39;R&amp;#39; color=&amp;#39;#ff0000&amp;#39;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Block val=&amp;#39;O&amp;#39; color=&amp;#39;#ff7700&amp;#39;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Block val=&amp;#39;Y&amp;#39; color=&amp;#39;#ffff00&amp;#39;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Block val=&amp;#39;G&amp;#39; color=&amp;#39;#00cc00&amp;#39;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Block val=&amp;#39;B&amp;#39; color=&amp;#39;#0077cc&amp;#39;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Block val=&amp;#39;I&amp;#39; color=&amp;#39;#5500aa&amp;#39;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Block val=&amp;#39;V&amp;#39; color=&amp;#39;#770077&amp;#39;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; ) } ReactDOM.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling a bit rusty lately, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to start making a little project and posting it here every day. Today&amp;rsquo;s thing is a simple calculator!
 You can play with the code here.
I originally put this together in basic JavaScript, which I found quite pleasant to write, but quite ugly to look at later, so I remade it in React. The core of the design is a simple state machine: the calculator is either collecting its first (or left) input, awaiting its second (right) input after an operator is pressed, collecting its right input, or displaying the result (which is stored in &amp;lsquo;left&amp;rsquo;) after pressing &amp;lsquo;=&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>As a kid, I had a handheld version of this game made by Tiger. For my siblings and me, it was neat distraction for a few weeks. Now, with some help from Blender and React, I can make it myself!
Clearly, it&amp;rsquo;s not finished yet. I just wanted to put up my progress with it after a few hours. Getting React and JSX to play nicely with Hugo wasn&amp;rsquo;t much trouble, and the game&amp;rsquo;s logic is pretty straightforward.</description>
